# FYP-Goole-Lens-Python

---

A project which i developed in my last year of a university degree. The application allows you to detect 80 objects, colours, detect text and logo. Using detected data, the user can then search for that product on an e-commerce website.

For this i have used Google API for logo detection and EasyOCR for text detection. Objects will be detected using YOLOv5 which is a great open source library to use. All colours have been stored in an excel file which can be accessed easily.
